    "## Motivation\n",
    "Obtaining the optimal subset $x_m$ of the feature matrix $\\Phi_{n,p}$ is a computationally hard problem in the case $\\Phi{n,p}$ has a large number of columns $p$. To examine all possible solutions for this problem by brute force has the complexity $\\binom{p}{m}$. To examine all possible subsets and combinations of the features has complexity $2^{p}$. To avoid computational overload, there exist methods like orthogonal design, penalized likelihood or heuristic optimization amongst others. This analysis is focused on the latter case. The basic heuristic approach is to apply an iterative method starting with an empty model (stepwise forward) and improve the model by adding features based on an evaluation criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general heuristic optimization procedures use iterative methods to approximate an optimum. The goal is to efficiently explore the search space in order to find near–optimal solutions. One branch within these algorithms are the evolutionary algorithms, which are inspired by natural processes. The harmony search algorithm (HS) also belongs to this group. It can be applied to various fields ranging from robotics to engineering. It is based on the principles of improvising jazz musicians, where each input variable refers to one muscician with the overall goal of creating an optimal harmony. The algorithm was proposed by Geem et al. in 2001. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this analysis I will explain the general mechanics of the HS algorithm and how it applies to the previously  mentioned variable selection problem. There will be two applications of the algorithm. In the first case, the algorithm has to identify the generating features within an artificial dataset. In a second case, the HS algorithm has to identify an optimal subset of features to classify and then predict high income individuals."

Without loss of generality and for the ease of understanding, this chapter shows the pseudocode and the implementation of the algorithm in the case of minimizing a function. Later, when adapting the algorithm for the variable selection problem both options will be built into the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main components are of HS are the following: the harmonic memory (HM), the memory consideration rate (HMCR) and the pitch adjusting rate (PAR). The HM accounts for the fact that musicians can choose from previosly tested melodies, as they do not have to built up a new melody entirely from scratch each improvisation. The harmony memory size (HMS) defines the amount of previously tested notes a musician can choose from. The PAR takes into account that musicians can slighly modify the notes to create a even better melody. So, each improvisation the musician chooses a known, a known but slightly modified or a random note. In the end, the notes form all musicians in the ensable form a melody or harmony which will be evaluated. Depending on the evaluation and wheather the harmony should be remembered for future improvisations, it will be stored in the HM.\n",

Therefore, the algorithm now has to make the descision wheather a specific variable enters into the model or not: each $x_{p}^{hms} \\in [0, 1] $. The evaluation at each iteration is based on hyperparameters calculated by fitting the proposed model. As the varibles are binary instead of continous the algorithm has to be slightly adapted as well. Firstly, there is no need to define the lower and upper bounds for the binary variables in the HM. Secondly, the binary setting does not require the parameter modification bandwidth. In case the PAR criterion is met, the contrary binary output is chosen. Additionally, the algorithm can handle maximization or minimization depending on the fitness function $f_{fitness}(x)$. A detailed discussion of $f_{fitness}(x)$ and the data used is found below.\n",

    "#### Observations < Features\n",
    "In the second part of this chapter, the analysis is focused on the cases where the number of features exceeds the number of observations. A first approach using HS with a divide and conquer approach did not work as expected. The idea was to split the data such that the number of features is smaller than the number of observations by using all observations but only a subset of features in each sub-dataset. Then, recursively merge the features which tend to contribute positively to the goodness of fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence the fitness function needs to be updated as OLS does not converge in these cases as stated earlier. As Lasso's performance also decreases in these cases, the approach would be to combine both methods with a moderate penalization for Lasso. To account for features which are not considered by Lasso but are considered by HS $(k_{wrong})$, we have to extend the penalization of $AIC_c$ to the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "For computational reasons, the eavaluation was limited to 200 improvisation and the standard setting for HS's parameters. The results extracted from the tables below show that a combination of both methods deliver best results given the settings. Above a certain number of features the results get somewhat fuzzy and need further research with a higher number of improvisations. "

    "#### Data Description\n",
    "The data is obtained from the UCI machine learning repository. It is a extraction from the 1994 US census database and contains over 30.000 observations with charachteristics on individual basis. It is labelled data, as every individual is assigned to an income group with the threshold of 50k USD. From a first check we can see that roughly 32% of the individuals earn more than the 50k USD threshold. The procedure used in further analysis is supervised learning. The data needs some preperation before the modeling activities can start. In a first step, missing values will be removed and the variables will be relabelled as necessary. Aditionally we standardize the continous variables. Secondly, dummy variables will be created for categorical variables. Then we check for feature correlation, which tend to be low amongst all features."

    "#### Evaluation Strategy\n",
    "The clean dataset provides $\\Phi$ with 43 features and over 30.000 observations. Assuming no causal inference from the model, one had to check for $2^{43}$ or roughly $8.8 \\cdot 10^{12}$ models by brute force, which is computationally unfeasible. As we care only about the predictional power of our model, we could use the HS algorithm to find an optimal subset of the parameter space to predict the income group. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the evaluating the predictional power, the approach is to split the data in 3 sets. The third set contains 10% of the data and serves as test data. The other 90% will be split in 70% training data and 30% validation data, which will be used to evaluate the models during the asessment phase. All datasets are drawn with stratification ensuring the balance of presence for both income groups. Splitting the data in three parts is no issue as it contains over 30k observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the algorithm a fitness function has to be defined to decide wheather a new combination of features enters the potential set of solutions. I tried various metrics (precision, accuracy, recall, etc.) related to the predictional power which tend return similar results as the AUC. Therefore, I will conduct the analysis for only two metrics as fitness functions for HS: \n",
    "- Minimizing the __AIC__ ensures a minimal model containing all relevant features trying to minimize the informational loss, calculated as follows: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "L _ { \\log } ( y , p ) = - \\log \\operatorname { Pr } ( y | p ) = - ( y \\log ( p ) + ( 1 - y ) \\log ( 1 - p ) )\\\\\n",
    "AIC = 2 k - 2 L _ { \\log } ( y , p )\n",
    "$$\n",
    "- Maximizing the __AUC__ ensures dececent predictional power of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying the HS, I will stick to the standard parameters which tend to deliver the best results as seen previously. The final models will be benchmarked against a random model and a statistical significant subset of the full model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of features included in the model is reduced by almost 30%, while maintaining the predictional power of the model compared to the corrected full model. Both variants definitely outperform the random model. Interestingly the results do not much differ comparing the AIC and the AUC as fitness function."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The HS algorithm can be applied to the problem of variable selection and delivers a decent performance under certain conditions. The most important condition for this procedure to work is that the fitness function is well defined. The conducted analysis has proven, that the algorithm performs well when applied to artificial and real data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of improvisations should be large, when applying the HS algorithm to obtian reliable results. Due to computational reasons the analysis is limited regarding the number of improvisations especially if the number of features exceeds the number of observations. In these settings the behaviour of the algorithm should be analyzed more carefully, but this is beyond the scope of this project. Additionally, other measures like Shannon's formula for uncertainty could be tested as a fitness function."
